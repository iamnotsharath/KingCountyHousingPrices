The specific problem addressed in this project revolves around understanding the determinants
of housing prices within the dataset. The dataset provides a rich collection of variables such as
bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage, offering a comprehensive view of the features that
contribute to the value of a house and the prices of houses are influenced by these
factors.Identifying these factors and their respective impacts on housing prices is our main
objective.
This project aims to investigate the determinants of housing prices using regression analysis
techniques. By analyzing the dataset, we seek to develop predictive models that can accurately
estimate housing prices based on various features. Through regression analysis, we can
identify the key factors driving housing prices and gain insights into how different variables
interact to influence property values.
To facilitate this investigation, we will utilize the housing dataset, which contains detailed
information on housing attributes such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage,
location, and other relevant features. This dataset, sourced from Kaggle.com , provides a
comprehensive and diverse set of variables for analyzing housing prices and understanding the
underlying factors affecting property values in the region.
Need to verify which of the predictive model works
